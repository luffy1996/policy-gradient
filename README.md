## Reinforcement learning using mlpack

**Reinforcement Learning** is a hot topic being discussed in the intelligence community.  In this project I have implemented a simple DQN algorithm using keras and mlpack. I compare the results and show how mlpack is time efficient. I have wriiten a blog on this project which can be found [here](https://rohanrajblogs.blogspot.in/2018/02/q-learning-using-mlpack.html) .
